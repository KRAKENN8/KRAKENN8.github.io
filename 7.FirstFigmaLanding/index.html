      <h2>Features of the Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Immersion in a Horror Atmosphere: The game creates a unique sense of anxiety 
        through gloomy locations, unexpected sound design, and visual details 
        that heighten feelings of isolation and inevitable danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Innovative Approach to Survival: By combining elements of puzzles 
        and survival, the player must not only fight enemies but also solve puzzles, 
        manage limited resources and make difficult decisions that impact 
        the progression of events.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Plot Filled with Mysteries and Symbolism: The story skillfully interweaves 
        the character's personal experiences with global mystical events, allowing 
        players to gradually uncover layers of narrative through discovered documents, 
        audio recordings, and enigmatic imagery.

            "Signalis is a real breakthrough in the horror genre. The game immerses you 
            in a world of nightmares and mysterious plot twists. The graphics and sound 
            design create a unique sense of fear and tension. A deeper moment could be

            "In Signalis, the survival mechanics are remarkably well-developed. Limited 
            resources, challenging puzzles, and the need for strategic thinking make the 
            game stand out. While there is a slight lack of precision, the overall 
            technical execution leaves a positive impression."

            symbolism. Every discovery and riddle adds new details to the overall 
            picture. The story, conveyed through mysterious documents and magical 
            imagery, offers plenty of room for personal interpretation."

            twists and a constant sense of threat make the game unforgettable. No 
            situation is without challenging mechanics, so hold on to the charm and 
            encourage you to keep exploring for new discoveries."
